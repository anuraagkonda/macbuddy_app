      Comments:   The bounding is done by using map.getBounds(). The bounds send by this function is sent to yelp api.
                  On geocoding the address results sent by yelp search results few address gives latitude and longitude 
                  greater than the bounds. Hence at times few markers are plotted nearby the bounds of maps.
                  This error is caused mainly because of address given in yelp response and also sometimes due to geocoder which
                  gives partial result according to documentation. Hence all the search is located within bounds and project is working properly
